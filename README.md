This app integrates CameraX with Firebase ML kit features.

It will take your selfies every 30 seconds(can be configured) while the app is on the background and when a face is detected.

The service will be killed when a selfie is captured, and will launch again after 30 seconds.

It is using the CameraX to interface the camera, and the face detection feature from Firebase ML kit to detect a face.
