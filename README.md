This app for the selfie lovers, integrates CameraX with Firebase ML kit features.

It will take your selfies every 30 seconds(can be configured) when a face is detected and the person is smiling, even when the app is on the background or killed.

The service will be killed when a selfie is captured, and will launch again after 30 seconds. The taken selfies are displayed in the app.

It is using the CameraX to interface the camera, and the face detection feature from Firebase ML kit to detect a face.
