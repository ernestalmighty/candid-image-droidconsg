This app for the selfie lovers, integrates CameraX with Firebase ML kit features.

It will take your selfies when a face is detected and the detected person is smiling, even when the app is on the background or killed.

The taken selfies are displayed in the app.

It is using the CameraX to interface the camera, and the face detection feature from Firebase ML kit to detect a face.
